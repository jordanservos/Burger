# Burger App -- Node Express Handlebars

## Overview
In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

It's also fully deployed on Heroku! - https://nodeburger-uofd.herokuapp.com/

3. Once devoured, burgers are moved to the left as "Past Orders"

4. You can order a burger again by selecting the "Re-Order" button in the "Past Orders" list!
